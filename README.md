# Employee_DataAnalysis_with_Pandas
## **Project Overview**
This project involves the analysis of employee data using **Pandas** in a **Jupyter Notebook**. The dataset contains employee details, including their **Employee_ID**, **Name**, **Age**, **Department**, **Salary**, and **Joining_Date**. The notebook performs various data analysis tasks such as filtering, calculating summary statistics, and handling missing data.

## **Features**
- **Data Importing**: Importing libraries such as `pandas` and `numpy`, and creating a sample employee dataset.
- **Data Inspection**: Loading the data into a Pandas DataFrame and displaying the structure using functions like `shape`, `dtypes`, and `head()`.
- **Data Cleaning**: Checking for missing values, handling `null` values, and transforming data as needed.
- **Data Analysis**: Filtering data based on specific criteria, such as employees with salaries between 60,000 and 70,000.
- **Summary Statistics**: Calculating the average age of employees and generating other descriptive statistics like mean, median, and standard deviation.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Python** (Programming Language)
- **Pandas** (Data Analysis Library)
- **Numpy** (Numerical Operations Library)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (IDE)
